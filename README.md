# Application name: refactored-pychatv1
# Developed by: Paolo Patron

# This python application can be used for localhost chat (127.0.0.1).
# There are two python classes in the project:
# (1) server 
# (2) client
# Server should be run first before the client. Multiple clients can connect to the same server and messages should be pushed to all clients connected to that server.
# Additional code will be needed if we want to configure this application to communicate between several IP addresses within the same WiFi network.

# Credits to people from YouTube which I used as reference to create/refactor this application.
# Hope this helps!
